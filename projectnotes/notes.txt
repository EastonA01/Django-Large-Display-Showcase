With Django, you work with your database almost exclusively through the models you define in code. 
Django's "migrations" then handle all the details of the underlying database automatically as you evolve 
the models over time. The general workflow is as follows:

1. Make changes to the models in your models.py file.
2. Run "python manage.py makemigrations" to generate scripts in the migrations folder that migrate the 
database from its current state to the new state.
3. Run "python manage.py migrate" to apply the scripts to the actual database.
